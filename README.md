# Elderly Home Management System (FYP)
As the proportion of the population aged 65 and above in Hong Kong has been steadily
growing. To accommodate the expected increase of residents in elderly homes in the future, a
web-based elderly home management system is designed in this paper. A modern and robust
full-stack technique named MERN stack is adopted to achieve the design, along with other
web technologies and optimizations that ensure the performance and security of the project.
As the system passes most of the test cases, the positive results indicate that this management
system can be widely adopted in different elderly homes. However, there is still room for
improvement. As the project would be focusing only on simplifying administration and
documentation for staff users. One of the areas that can be further extended is the adoption of
cloud services and Internet of Things (IoT) services. The system can also be expected to
expand to different system structures such as mobile applications that help improve the user
experiences and documentation performance for respective users.
