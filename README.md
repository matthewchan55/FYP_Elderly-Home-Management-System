# Elderly Home Management System (FYP)
As the proportion of the population aged 65 and above in Hong Kong has been steadily
growing. To accommodate the expected increase of residents in elderly homes in the future, a
web-based elderly home management system is designed in this paper. A modern and robust
full-stack technique named MERN stack is adopted to achieve the design, along with other
web technologies and optimizations that ensure the performance and security of the project.
As the system passes most of the test cases, the positive results indicate that this management
system can be widely adopted in different elderly homes. However, there is still room for
improvement. As the project would be focusing only on simplifying administration and
documentation for staff users. One of the areas that can be further extended is the adoption of
cloud services and Internet of Things (IoT) services. The system can also be expected to
expand to different system structures such as mobile applications that help improve the user
experiences and documentation performance for respective users.

This project aims to provide services to elderly homes without a technical management
system and improve the quality of services and management by achieving three objectives.
First, to transform the paper-based management mode of elderly homes into organized and
electronic management, which can be achieved by building a computerized web-based
management system to replace manual and written records. Second, to reduce the potential
human errors in documentation, a simple yet efficient system is constructed to cater for the
fast working pace in elderly homes. Standardization of the record is also assured. Third, to
provide optimal caring services to the elderly by reducing colleagues’ workload, in addition to
the aforementioned elderly electronic health records that can help caregivers take fast and
appropriate health care to the elderly, other modules such as staff management, facility
management and medical management are also developed for administrative colleagues. The
workload of both of the positions can be lightened under systematic management. To
conclude, it is hoped that the project can utilize administrative colleagues and caregivers’
routine duties so that the caring performance brought to the elderly can be the best possible.
Due to the limitations of time scale and resources, this project only focuses on building a
management system for elderly homes by investigating its purpose and methodology in the
literature review. Concepts of “smart elderly home” and other modern technology which can
also support the caring system such as Internet of Things (IoT) or any real-time monitoring
and tracking systems are not designed.
